## Unsolved Problems/Further Work

I had a difficult time coming up with uses for javascript on my website. I found it simpler to use CSS for most of the movement on the page. I think I could reimagine the website with a more JS intensive design and would like to in the future. I also worked really hard trying to get the design to look clean but I'm not completely satisfied with the result and want to spend some more time working on that. Ultimately I'd like to create a single page with all the sections and switch between them using javascript and nav buttons.
